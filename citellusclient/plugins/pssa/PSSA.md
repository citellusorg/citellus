Product Specific Supportability Assessment  (PSSA)

Supportability Assessment Process

By today a PSSA for OpenShift is manual process. To make more scalable by using automation is under discussion, but not yet implement. To conduct an assessment you may execute the following steps:
  1. Before committing to run an assessment, please check 
    a. with your manager if you have a mandate to do as it is a lot of effort
    b. If you have template for the OpenShift release available the customer is using. As OpenShift is a super fast evolving product this is essential as the template for a different OCP feature release potentially will lead to wrong results.
  2. Manage your customers expectations
    a. He has to contribute a bunch of information. What is effort on him
    b. The result will be valid for this snapshot. So the outcome might be different, 
      i. if he upgrades the cluster
      ii. Changes the cluster config or extends the cluster.
      iii. It is also valid for this cluster only. Not any other cluster he has.

  3. Request the information from the customer
  4. Run the assessment, based on the shared information
    a. Don’t miss to maintain the preface
    b. Run the checks one by one
    c. Come up with recommendations and conclusions based on the results
    d. Write the executive summary
  5. Share the draft with you manager for an approval. He might like to get your writing cross-checked by legal. Please have in mind that not everybody is allowed to give a statement on behalf of Red Hat CEE. What basically is what the customer expects to get with a supportability assessment.
  6. If you have the approval to share it with customer share a PDF/A document only and please don’t forget to send it to the members of the VAT also. Please also archive it also so that all CEE has access to in case there is an issue anytime later.
